## Technologies Used

- React: Front end is built with React. React Route enables the page navigarion.
- Redux: [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is used to create reducers and handle async request lifecycles from [Exercise DB API](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb).
- Express
- GraphQL && Apollo
- MongoDB && Mongoose
- JWT
- IndexedDB: to save the exercise data from Exercise DB API to the client side.
- [Lazy loading image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading): Used [react-lazy-load-image-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lazy-load-image-component) to allow lazy loading images and improve web performance.
- [lossless compression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Lossless_compression): Used [compress-create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compress-create-react-app) and [express-static-gzip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-static-gzip) packages to enable both [gzip](https://www.gzip.org) compression and [brotli](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Brotli_compression) compression, which significantly reduced the application load time.
- This website is a PWA and meat responsive design.
